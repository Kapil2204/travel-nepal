            <p>I travelled to Nepal for treking, hiking with a few friends. I had never been to Nepal or the Himalayas before. Our tour was 
               expertly planned by most experienced Trekking expert guide in Nepal. The nicest part is that he served as our guide while on 
               the journey. He is quite intelligent and professional, especially when it comes to hiking in Nepal. So, I’d like to thank him 
               and his crew for making our trip special. I am damn sure to return to Nepal for another adventurous vacation. Really the trip
                was amazing and full of memories.</p>

            <p>We walked the Annapurna Circuit with Nabin Gurung in September-October 2019. The experience was fantastic in any way possible. Nabin and his crew took care of us and the kids (ages 9, 13, 15) and were incredibly knowledgeable and supportive throughout the AC walk. That includes taking care of our needs, of accommodation, food (3 meals a day), interaction with locals and introduction to Nepalese culture and people. We warmly recommend talking to Nabin (+9779865168926, available on WhatApp too) if you're planning a trek in Nepal. We went there for my son's Bar Mitzvah trip and our experience was truly fabulous.</p>
